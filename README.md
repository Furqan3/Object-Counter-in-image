# Object Counter in Python OpenCV and NumPy
This project is a simple object detection program that uses OpenCV and NumPy libraries in Python. The program takes a binary image as input and identifies individual objects within the image. It then color codes each object to differentiate it from other objects in the image.

## Features
- Object detection in binary images
- Color coding of individual objects
- Easy integration with other Python projects
- Utilizes popular and widely-used libraries OpenCV and NumPy
- Lightweight and fast
## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using pip:
```pip
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```
## Usage
To use the Object Counter, simply run the ***object_counter.py*** script and provide the binary image file as an argument. The program will then detect all the objects within the image and color code them for easy identification.
```python
python object_counter.py /path/to/binary/image
```
